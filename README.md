Hat Hunters is a fast paced, top down looter shooter with gory pixel graphics and extravagant hats. It employs aspects of ‘bullet hell’ games such as slowed enemy projectiles and low player health in order to create a combat loop that heavily rewards player skill in both evasive movement, and accurate shooting. The central idea of Hat Hunters is to provide fast paced 2D combat, supplemented by a diverse loot system. The loot system serves to take the monotony out of the gameplay loop, while also providing the player much needed downtime between hectic combat encounters. The gameplay is fast paced, with high movement speed, low health, and lots of big guns. Hat Hunters features no official class system, instead special abilities are tied to super rare and highly coveted items that can be found within the game. These items are equippable hats. Each hat, aside from being large and extravagant, gives the player certain abilities when equipped. Each hat has a very clear theme that applies to both its appearance and the abilities it applies. These abilities adjust the combat loop in their own unique ways, further supplementing the core combat mechanics by diversifying the experience.

Without going into much detail, the story in Hat Hunters is fairly well developed and exists to supplement the main gameplay loop. It should never be intrusive in any way and should be able to be ignored. Hat Hunters begins in the future where the system is being fought over by two competing factions, the utterly totalitarian, imperialist Hestian Dynasty, and the anarcho-capitalist Helios corporation. Each faction occupies roughly half the planets in the system and they wage constant war amongst each other. The game takes place on the frontier planet of Tartarus which is not fully owned by either faction, but highly coveted by both due to it’s mysterious alien artifacts(like hats). The war in the system is at its most violent on Tartarus, and malevolent alien forces are waking up. None but the bravest of mercenaries venture there despite the vast riches to be found. The player is one of these mercenaries, an enemy of both the Hestian Dynasty and the Helios corporation, a hunter of gold, loot, and forgotten alien artifacts.
